** Seemingly Unrelated Regressions **

SETUP
We are interested in estimating the following regressions for four firms in the Grunfeld data set. The data set includes 20 observations from 1935-1954 on the each firmӳ gross investment in plant and equipment, millions of $1947, inv, the value of each firmӳ common and preferred stock, millions of $1947, v, and each firmӳ capital stock of the firm, k. The firms are indicated by the numbers 4, 5, 6 or 7 at the end of the variables.  4 = Chrysler, 5 = Atlantic Richfield, 6 = IBM, 7 = Union Oil. Source: H. D. Vinod and A. Ullah, Recent Advances in Regression Models, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1981, Table 10.1

** Run the SUR regression

sureg (inv4 v4 k4) (inv5 v5 k5) (inv6 v6 k6) (inv7 v7 k7)

** Run individual regression and save residuals

reg inv4 v4 k4
predict res4, residuals

reg inv5 v5 k5
predict res5, residuals

reg inv6 v6 k6
predict res6, residuals

reg inv7 v7 k7
predict res7, residuals

** Display the correlation matrix of the residuals

 corr (res4 res5 res6 res7)
 matrix rho = r(C)
 matrix list rho
** Create and display the LM statistic

scalar LM = 20*(0.1135^2+0.2014^2+0.1562^2+(-0.1217)^2+0.1543^2+0.1348^2)
di LM

** Create and display the p-value for the LM statistic

scalar LMp = chi2tail(6,LM)
di LMp

** Estimate the equations with a SUR model again and display the correlation matrix and the LM test

sureg (inv4 v4 k4) (inv5 v5 k5) (inv6 v6 k6) (inv7 v7 k7), corr

** Test the joint significance of the coefficients on the value of each firmӳ common and preferred stock, v

test v4=v5=v6=v7=0

** Test that the coefficients on the value of each firmӳ common and preferred stock, v, are all equal

test v4=v5=v6=v7

** Test that the coefficients on the value of each firmӳ common and preferred stock, v, are all equal to 0.10

test v4=v5=v6=v7=0.10
