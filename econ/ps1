* 1b. LM test
* Null hypothesis: The disturbance terms of the individual regressions are not contemporaneously correlated. (i.e. zero contemporaneous covariance between the errors of different equations). 
* Alternative hypothesis: The disturbance terms of the individual regressions are contemporaneously correlated. 

* Test-statistic: Lagrange Multiplier (LM) statistic. LM is a sum of the squared correlations between the residuals. 
* Distribution: The LM follows a chi-squared distribution with M(M-1)/2 degrees of freedom, where M is the number of equations. 
* The LM statistic is multiplied by t, the number of observations, 26; in this case, t = 26. Since there are 3 equals, the LM statistic follows a chi-squared distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. 
* Conclusion: Since the p-value is less than 0.01, at the 0.05 alpha level, we reject the null hypothesis that the regressions are not correlated. 

* Display the correlation matrix of the residuals

* Create the LM statistic

** Create and display the p-value for the LM statistic
scalar LMp = chi2tail(3,LM)

* 1c. Seemingly Unrelated Regression technique. 
*Form cross product matrix 
sureg (c1 p1 r1 c1t) (c2 p2 r2 c2t) (c3 p3 r3 c3t)
matrix reg4 = r(table)
putexcel A30=matrix(reg4)

* Estimate the equations with a SUR model again and display the correlation matrix and the LM test
sureg (c1 p1 r1 c1t) (c2 p2 r2 c2t) (c3 p3 r3 c3t), corr

* See attached for table. 
* 1d. Seemingly Unrelated Regression technique. 
* In the attached table, the OLS vs. SUR technique led to different coefficients, standard errors, and p-values. 
* For both techniques, most of the predictor variables were statistically significant in predicting present year cattle inventories. 
* The primary difference is that the constants were statistically significant in the SUR technique but not in the OLS regressions.

*Question 2

*Demand equation 
reg lquan lprice mon tue wed thu rainy cold
*Supply Equation 
reg lquan lprice stormy 
reg lprice lquan stormy 

*2a. Structural form and reduced form 
*Structural form equations represent a system of equations, and contain endogenous variables (variables determined by the system of equations), exogenous variables (variables determined outside of the system), and disturbance terms.  
*Reduced form equations express endogenous variables as functions only of exogenous variables (and predetermined variables) and disturbances. The reduced form equations are the equations that result when we use the structural equations to solve for the endogenous variables.

*The reduced form equations for this model are: 
*Set quantity from the supply and demand equations equal to each other. 
*a1+a2*lprice+a3*mon+a4*tue+a5*wed+a6*thu+a7*rain+a8*cold+e_demand= 
*b1+b2*lprice+b3storm+e_supply

* We can solve for the log of price (lprice) in terms of the exogenous variables (mon, tues, wed, thu, rain, cold, stormy). 
* Thus, lprice is in the general form: lprice = pi_1*x + v_1
* We plug the equation for lprice back into the supply equation, to find the log of quantity (lquantity) in terms of the exogenous variables (mon, tues, wed, thu, rain, cold, stormy). 
* Thus, lquan is in the general form: lquan = pi_2*x + v_2

*2b. Reduced Form equations 
* Price
reg lprice mon tue wed thu rainy cold stormy
* Quantity 
reg lquan mon tue wed thu rainy cold stormy

* For the price equation, only the coefficient on "stormy" is statistically significant. 
* For the quantity equation, the coefficients on "tue", "wed", and "stormy" are statistically significant. 

* 2c. The term "identification" refers to the number of reduced form coefficients to estimate the structural parameters of the equations. 
* The demand equation is exactly identified; there are just enough reduced form coefficients to estimate the structural parameters of the demand equation. 
* The supply equation is overidentified; there are 6 exogenous variables to predict the 1 endogenous variable. 
 
* Demand Equation 
ivregress 2sls lquan mon tue wed thu rainy cold (lprice = stormy)

* Supply Equation 
ivregress 2sls lquan stormy (lprice = mon tue wed thu rainy cold) 

* For the demand equation, the coefficient on lprice to predict lquan is -1.22, meaning that a higher price at equilibrium leads to lower quantity. Amongst the exogenous variables, "tue" and "wed" are statistically significant predictors of quantity. 
* For the supply equation, the coefficient on lprice is -.15; the supply curve appears to be more inelastic than the demand curve. "Stormy" is not a significant predictor of quantity. 

* Three-stage least-squares regression results 
global demand "(qDemand: lquan lprice mon tue wed thu rainy cold)"
global supply "(qSupply: lquan lprice stormy)"
reg3 $demand $supply, endog(lquan lprice) exog(mon tue wed thu rainy cold stormy)

*Test: This is a test of the joint significance of the coefficients in predictors of cattle inventories for each region. 
*Null hypothesis: 
The null hypothesis is that the coefficient on the variable v in all four the equations are equal to zero. The alternative is that in at least one of the equations the coefficient on the variable v is not equal to zero.

*Alternative Hypothesis:
