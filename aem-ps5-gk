*On average, NJ had an increase in full-time employment, of .28 per store, while non-New Jersey stores experienced an average decrease of 2 FTE.

*The sizeable increase in the standard errors is due to the fact that there is heteroscedasticity of the standard errors. In other words, the impact of being in NJ, and the time period after the minimum wage increase, and the interaction between these two variables, varies by store. Thus, we must include robust standard errors to account for heteroscedasticity. 

*3. Estimate following model in levels, i.e. with the LHS in levels.
*Estimate two different versions of the model with different standard errors.

*None of the coefficients are significant. 
*No difference with the robust standard errors. 

*4. Cluster on sheet
reg fte5 nj njafter after, cluster(sheet)

*For the dummy variable after, and the interation term nj*after, the standard errors clustered on sheet are smaller than the robust standard errors.  

*5. Fixed effects
xtset sheet
xtreg fte5 nj njafter after, fe
outreg2 using ps5-table.xls, append ctitle("FTE-5 Levels, Fixed Effects") label

* The NJ variable gets dropped since the fixed effects accounts for any variation unique to the New Jersey stores. 

*6. The estimated impact of the minimum wage is the same in all these models. Across the models, the change in minimum wage led to an overall decrease in full-time employment, but an increase in FTE for stores in New Jersey. 

*7. The graph demonstrates persistant increase in employment in the 7 counties in PA, compared to the 14 counties in PA and NJ. Thus, there a minimum wage increase may have a long-term impact in decreasing growth in employment.

***When assessing the impact on loan balances of being in the treatment group, the interest rate change and the interaction between being in the treatment group and the interest rate change, all of the coefficients are significant. 

*Thus, the comparison & treatment branches have different level of loan balances (i.e. intercept) pre-interest rate change. The TIKA group started with higher loan balances in the beginning. 

*For the TIKA group, the interest rate change led to significantly lower loan balances after the interest rate change. For the non TIKA group, the interest rate change led to significantly higher loan balances after the interest rate change. 

*Does this change persist when you control for variables tinpr and nage?

*When controlling for the time in the program and age of the borrower, the TIKA group actually has lower starting loan balances than the control group. However, the impact of the interest rate change remains the same in direction for the TIKA and non-TIKA group, such that the interest rate change leads to decreased loan balances in the TIKA group and increased loan balances in the non-TIKA group.
