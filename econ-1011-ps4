*Q1b.
*In order for near4 and near2 to be valid instruments, we assume that the instrumental variables are relevant and exogenous. 
*Thus, near4 and near2 should have statistically significant coefficients in the first stage least squares regression model. 
*While near4 is statistically significant, near2 is not. The results remain the same even when including control variables. 

*Q2
*Estimate the structural model, with near4 and near2 as instruments for educ.

* We cannot reject the null hypothesis as the p-value is larger than 0.05. 
* A statistically significant test statistic could represent either an invalid instrument or an incorrectly specified structural equation.
* Because the test-statistic is not statistically significant, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that near4 and near2 are valid instruments.

*For this version of the Hausman test, since the chi-square statistic is not larger than the critical value, 
*we fail to reject the null hypothesis that educ is an exogenous variable.

*Q3a. The null hypothesis of the Wu-Hausman test is that the variable under consideration, education, is exogenous. 
*The coefficient of interest has a t-test of -1.71, and a p-value of 0.087.

*Q3b.The ocnclusion of the test is that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 5% level, but can be rejected at the 10% level. 
*Thus, the level of significance will determine whether education is deemed an endogenous variable. 
*At the 5% level, education is an endogenous variable. 
*At the 10% level, we can reject the null hypothesis to conclude that education is exogenous.

*Q4a.
*The null hypothesis of the Breusch-Pagan test for heteroscedasticity tests whether the variance of the errors from a regression is dependent on the values of the independent variables. 
*In that case, heteroskedasticity is present.
*The lagrange multiplier is one half of the explained sum of squares of the regresion of g on Z
*under the null hypothesis, the LM has a chi-square distribution with the degrees of freedom equal to the rank of Z.
