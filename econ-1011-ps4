*Q1b.
*In order for near4 and near2 to be valid instruments, we assume that the instrumental variables are relevant and exogenous. 
*Thus, near4 and near2 should have statistically significant coefficients in the first stage least squares regression model. 
*While near4 is statistically significant, near2 is not. The results remain the same even when including control variables. 

*Q2
*Estimate the structural model, with near4 and near2 as instruments for educ.

* We cannot reject the null hypothesis as the p-value is larger than 0.05. 
* A statistically significant test statistic could represent either an invalid instrument or an incorrectly specified structural equation.
* Because the test-statistic is not statistically significant, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that near4 and near2 are valid instruments.

*Q3a. The null hypothesis of the Wu-Hausman test is that the variable under consideration, education, is exogenous. 
*The coefficient of interest has a t-test of -1.71, and a p-value of 0.087.

*Q3b.The ocnclusion of the test is that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at the 5% level, but can be rejected at the 10% level. 
*Thus, the level of significance will determine whether education is deemed an endogenous variable. 
*At the 5% level, education is an endogenous variable. 
*At the 10% level, we can reject the null hypothesis to conclude that education is exogenous.

*estat hettest performs three versions of the Breusch-Pagan (1979) and Cook-Weisberg (1983) test for heteroskedasticity. 
*All three versions of this test present evidence against the null hypothesis that t=0 in Var(e)=sigma^2 exp(zt).  In the normal version, performed by default, the null hypothesis also includes the assumption that the regression disturbances are independent-normal draws with variance sigma^2.  The normality assumption is dropped from the null hypothesis in the iid and fstat versions, which respectively produce the score and F tests discussed in Methods and formulas in [R] regress postestimation.  If varlist is not specified, the fitted values are used for z.  If varlist or the rhs option is specified, the variables specified are used for z.

*The lagrange multiplier is one half of the explained sum of squares of the regresion of g on Z
*Under the null hypothesis, the LM has a chi-square distribution with the degrees of freedom equal to the rank of Z. 

*Q5a. The null hypothesis of White test for heteroscedasticity is that the variance of the errors in a regression model is constant.
*If the null hypothesis holds, then we assume homoskedasticity of the standard errors.

*Q5b. The auxiliary regression used to manually 
To test for constant variance one undertakes an auxiliary regression analysis: this regresses the squared residuals from the original regression model onto a set of regressors that contain the original regressors along with their squares and cross-products. One then inspects the R2. The Lagrange multiplier (LM) test statistic is the product of the R2 value and sample size:


*Q5c. The sampling distribution  of the test statistic for the White test for heteroscedasticity if the null hypothesis is true? Explain where the degrees of freedom come from.

The test statistic, the lagrange multiplier, follows a chi-squared distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to P − 1, where P is the number of estimated parameters (in the auxiliary regression).

The logic of the test is as follows. First, the squared residuals from the original model serve as a proxy for the variance of the error term at each observation. (The error term is assumed to have a mean of zero, and the variance of a zero-mean random variable is just the expectation of its square.) The independent variables in the auxiliary regression account for the possibility that the error variance depends on the values of the original regressors in some way (linear or quadratic). If the error term in the original model is in fact homoskedastic (has a constant variance) then the coefficients in the auxiliary regression (besides the constant) should be statistically indistinguishable from zero and the R2 should be “small". Conversely, a “large" R2 (scaled by the sample size so that it follows the chi-squared distribution) counts against the hypothesis of homoskedasticity.
An alternative to the White test is the Breusch–Pagan test, where the Breusch-Pagan test is designed to detect only linear forms of heteroskedasticity. Under certain conditions and a modification of one of the tests, they can be found to be algebraically equivalent.[4]
If homoskedasticity is rejected one can use heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors.

*Q6. 
*All of the classical Linear Regression Model Assumptions hold except for the assumption of homoscedasticity. 
*We would want to use robust (White) standard errors of the estimated coefficients instead of the usual standard errors to conduct hypothesis tests because instead of the usual  because in case of heteroscedasticity
*The difference in the conventional estimated variance of the OLS estimators and the White's estimated variance of the OLS estimators is
